				<span class="cell__body">Authorisation of the goods, software and/or technology has been granted under Article 26 of the Export Control Order 2008, as amended.</span>
				<span class="cell__subheading">Conditions</span>
				<span class="cell__body">1. This condition applies if listed items are being exported from the United Kingdom to a destination outside the territory of the Member States of the European Community. The licensee must quote the number of this licence to the proper officer of HM Revenue and Customs when the listed items are presented to that officer for export or must comply with such alternative arrangements as are agreed with that officer.</span>
				<span class="cell__body">2. This condition applies if listed items are being exported from the United Kingdom to a destination in the territory of a Member State of the European Community:</span>
				<span class="cell__body">a. The licensee must quote the number of this licence to the proper officer of HM Revenue and Customs at least three working days before the date of the proposed export identifying a location where the listed items will be capable of inspection at any time during those three days, or shall comply with such alternative arrangements as are agreed with an officer of HM Revenue and Customs. This paragraph does not apply where the licensee is exporting firearms covered by EC Directive 91/477/EEC or ammunition for use therewith.</span>
				<span class="cell__body">b. The licensee must:</span>
				<span class="cell__body">i. maintain records of all transactions carried out under this licence,</span>
				<span class="cell__body">ii. present a copy of these records each time the licence is presented to HM Revenue & Customs,</span>
				<span class="cell__body">iii. permit these records to be inspected and copied by any person authorised by the Secretary of State or the Commissioners, and iv. inform the Export Control Organisation ("ECO") when the licence becomes exhausted.</span>
				<span class="cell__body">3. This condition applies if listed items are being exported or transferred from a Member State of the European Community other than the United Kingdom.

				<span class="cell__body">4. This condition applies if listed items (being software or technology) have been transferred. The licensee must keep records that contain sufficient detail to allow the following to be identified:</span>
				<span class="cell__body">a. A description of the listed items that have been transferred;</span>
				<span class="cell__body">b. The date(s) of the transfer(s); and</span>
				<span class="cell__body">c. In so far as it is known to the licensee, the name and address of the end-user of the listed items.</span>

				<span class="cell__body">6. The licensee must make and maintain all necessary arrangements (including all necessary security arrangements) and must at all times retain sufficient control of the listed items to ensure that they are safely returned to the country of origin before the end of the expiry date; the licensee must not transfer to any person ownership of the listed items or any interest in them or take any action which may have the result of impeding or diminishing his power to ensure their safe return to the country of origin before the end of the expiry date.</span>
				<span class="cell__body">7. The licensee must ensure that the listed items only pass through a country not specified in this licence where this is necessary for them to reach their final destination and/or to return from that destination to the country of origin.</span>
				<span class="cell__body">8. The ECO shall be kept fully and accurately informed of:</span>
				<span class="cell__body">a. Each place where the listed items are kept or pass through after export; and</span>
				<span class="cell__body">b. Any occurrence which may result in the listed items or any part of them not being returned to the country of origin before the end of the expiry date.</span>
				<span class="cell__body">9. As soon as the listed items have been returned to the country of origin, the licensee shall send to ECO notice of their return together with any documentary evidence thereof.</span>
				<span class="cell__body">10. The licensee shall ensure that the listed items will not be used for any purpose other than that declared in the application form for this licence.</span>
				<span class="cell__body">Note: The granting of this temporary export licence sets no precedent in respect of any subsequent applications to permanently export or transfer similar goods, software and/or technology.</span>
