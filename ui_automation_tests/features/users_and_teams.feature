    # Edits the new team and makes sure new team is in team list
    When I edit my team
    Then I see the team in the team list
    # Clicks on new team and makes sure user list is empty.
    When I click on the team BlueOcean
    Then I see my teams user list with user "not added"
    # Adds new user to new team.
    # Also edits the users email to make sure a user can be edited.
