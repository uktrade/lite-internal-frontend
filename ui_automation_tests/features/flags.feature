    Then I see error message "Enter a name which is not already in use by another flag"

  @LT_950_empty

  Scenario: Add a flag with over 20 characters field
    Given I go to flags

    Then I see error message "Ensure this field has no more than 20 characters."

  @LT_950_edit @setup
  Scenario: Edit a flag

    And I click include deactivated
    Then I see one less active flags
